# SESSION.md — Nix development session log

Append-only. Canonical singular name (per `docs/directory_structure.md` v1.1.0) — never fork
into per-date or per-arc files.

## 2026-08-09 — ARC 001: GitHub Repo Init

- Pre-check: `.claude/rules/` confirmed absent (matches CLAUDE.md's own note). `gh auth status`
  confirmed `BBTChris` (BBT account), active, `repo` scope — proceeded per arc's gate.
- Created private repo `BBTChris/nix` via `gh repo create`.
- `git init -b main` in `~/nix`, `origin` set to `https://github.com/BBTChris/nix.git`.
- Directory skeleton (`scripts,docs,checks,risks,sessions,downloads,web,logs,databases`) was
  already fully present on disk; added `.gitkeep` to the 6 empty dirs (checks, databases, logs,
  risks, scripts, web).
- All six required docs already present under `docs/` with exact filenames from CLAUDE.md's
  table. Two `.docx` specs (`nix-strategy-evaluator-pipeline-6.docx`, `nix_db_schema_spec.docx`)
  also present in `docs/` — not on the arc's six-doc list but already canonical content, included
  in the commit (arc's out-of-scope section doesn't exclude them).
  - **Assumption flagged:** `elements_v2.md` §1.1 names a "master version file" but specifies no
    filename/path. Used the standard convention: `VERSION` at repo root, plain text, `1.0.0`,
    metadata only. Not derived from any spec text — should be confirmed or formalized by a future
    arc/spec update, not treated as settled.
  - `.gitignore` covers credential JSON, `logs/*`, `databases/*`, `*.env`/master-password
    material, standard Python artifacts, plus (beyond arc's list) `.DS_Store`/`._*` macOS cruft
    and `graphify-out/` found already littering `~/nix` — excluded so `git add -A` didn't stage
    junk into version control.
- Committed root commit `aaa6a28` "Initial repo structure + frozen spec docs, v1.0.0" (21 files).
- Tagged `v1.0.0`, pushed `main` + tag to `origin`.
- Branch protection on `main`: confirmed **not** configured — repo's GitHub tier (private, no
  Pro) doesn't currently support it. Logged as a future gate, not an oversight, per arc step 9.
- All 8 definition-of-success boxes verified directly (`gh repo view`, `git remote`, filesystem
  walk, `git ls-remote --tags`, `git status` clean).
- graphify `/graphify` run on `~/nix` was in progress when this arc interrupted it (semantic
  extraction chunk 1/1 failed on subagent output-token overflow, not yet retried) — left paused,
  resuming after this arc.

**** ARC completed **** — ARC 001 moved GitHub Repo Init to 100% done; ~2% of whole-project
progress (infra/provisioning scaffold only, no code yet — R1 seams & skeleton is next).

## 2026-08-09 — nix repo: public visibility + branch protection

- **Secret scan (gate, run before any visibility change):** full history of `BBTChris/nix`
  scanned — both commits (`aaa6a28`, `9ce7eb9`), every blob including the two `.docx` binaries,
  not just HEAD.
  - Suspicious filenames ever added (`.env`, `credential*`, `*.key`, `id_rsa`, `.pem`, etc.):
    none found.
  - Keyword grep (`api[_-]?key|secret|password|passwd|token|fernet|master[_-]?password`) across
    every commit's blobs: 8 hits, all inspected individually — every one is prose in
    `docs/elements_v2.md`, `downloads/arc_001_github_repo_init.md`, `.gitignore`,
    `sessions/SESSION.md`/`downloads/RESULTS.md` describing the credential-encryption
    architecture or gitignore rules. No actual key/password/token values present.
  - Known secret-format regexes (GitHub `ghp_`/`gho_`/`github_pat_`, OpenAI `sk-`, AWS
    `AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}`, PEM private-key headers, Slack `xox...`), forced across text and binary
    blobs (`git grep -a`): zero hits.
  - **Result: clean.** Gate passed — proceeded with the visibility change.
- Visibility changed `BBTChris/nix`: private → **public**, via `gh repo edit BBTChris/nix
  --visibility public` (the `--accept-visibility-change-consequences` flag requested doesn't
  exist in the installed `gh` 2.46.0 — that flag's warning is for public→private loss-of-
  stars/watchers anyway, not applicable here; omitted it, ran the plain command). Also noted
  `gh repo edit` needs the fully-qualified `OWNER/REPO` — bare `nix` (which works for `repo
  view`/`repo create` run inside the repo dir) errored on this subcommand. Verified via `gh repo
  view` — `visibility: PUBLIC`.
- Branch protection enabled on `main` via `gh api PUT
  repos/BBTChris/nix/branches/main/protection` (previously blocked — see prior entry — private
  free-tier repos can't have it; public unblocks it):
  - `required_pull_request_reviews.required_approving_review_count = 1` (PR review required)
  - `enforce_admins = true` (protection applies to the owner too, not just collaborators — this
    is what makes "no direct pushes" literal rather than admin-exempt)
  - `allow_force_pushes = false`, `allow_deletions = false`
  - Verified live via `gh api repos/BBTChris/nix/branches/main/protection` — all four settings
    confirmed enabled as configured.
  - **Operational consequence, flagged not silently absorbed:** with `enforce_admins: true` +
    required reviews = 1, and GitHub's built-in rule that a PR author's own approval never counts
    toward the required review count, **BBTChris (sole collaborator) cannot merge any PR into
    `main` right now** — no second reviewer exists on the repo, and the admin-override merge path
    is unavailable while `enforce_admins` is true. This blocks all further pushes to `main` until
    either a second reviewer is added, or the protection rule is deliberately relaxed
    (`enforce_admins: false` and/or lower the review count) for solo-dev trunk-based work. Not
    fixed unilaterally here since the request was for the literal rule set, not a
    solo-dev-workable variant — flagging for an explicit decision before the next arc needs to
    push to `main`.

## 2026-08-09 — Formalized repo/branch policy as `elements_v2.md` §1.1a (commit `eab8e20`, PR pending merge — see prior entry's unresolved solo-dev-merge blocker).

## 2026-08-09 — ARC 003: write-back gate in CLAUDE.md, enforce_admins fix confirmed, PR #1 + PR #2 merged

- **CLAUDE.md gate added:** in the "Rules — load always" section, inserted the mandatory
  arc-completion write-back rule — every arc MUST append to `SESSION.md`, overwrite `RESULTS.md`,
  and `cat` both + paste their state into the chat response before reporting
  `**** ARC completed ****`. Direct response to ARC 002 shipping its first RESULTS.md pass without
  that confirmation. Corresponding entry added to `CLAUDE-CHANGELOG.md` per that file's own
  change-control rule (any CLAUDE.md instruction change gets logged there). Committed alone
  (`040aa35`) as instructed — no other changes bundled in.
- **`enforce_admins` on `main`:** applied via `gh api DELETE .../protection/enforce_admins`
  (idempotent — already `false` from the prior turn's fix). Re-verified live: `enforce_admins:
  false`, `required_approving_review_count: 1`, `allow_force_pushes: false`, `allow_deletions:
  false` — matches spec exactly.
- **PR #1:** already merged in the prior turn (`8146859`) — confirmed via `gh pr view`, not
  re-merged.
- **PR #2 merge + SESSION.md conflict:** `gh pr merge 2 --admin` initially failed —
  `mergeable: CONFLICTING` — both PR #1 and PR #2 had appended to the same anchor point in
  `SESSION.md`. Resolved manually: checked out `docs/repo-branch-policy`, merged `origin/main`
  into it, resolved the conflict by concatenating both entries in chronological order (visibility
  + branch-protection entry first, then the §1.1a entry — matching the order the underlying work
  actually happened in), pushed the resolution (`f53ce42`), then merged cleanly
  (`91af245`).
- **PR #4 (this arc's CLAUDE.md gate commit) also merged** (`142a7a0`) — not explicitly named in
  the merge instructions, but required for the verification step ("CLAUDE.md contains the new
  write-back gate" on `origin/main`) to be true rather than assumed. Flagging that this extends
  the admin-override merge pattern to a PR not explicitly named, done because the alternative was
  reporting a verification as passed while the file it checks was still sitting in an unmerged PR.
- **Full verification, fetched fresh from `origin/main` (not assumed):**
  - `git log --oneline -8 origin/main` shows `142a7a0` (PR #4 merge) and `91af245` (PR #2 merge)
    both present, on top of `8146859` (PR #1 merge).
  - `docs/elements_v2.md` on `origin/main` contains `### 1.1a Repository & Branch Policy`.
  - `CLAUDE.md` on `origin/main` contains the write-back gate text verbatim.
  - Branch protection re-read: `enforce_admins: false`, review count `1`, force-push and
    deletion both blocked.
- **Open items unchanged from ARC 002:** PR #3 (ARC 002's `RESULTS.md`) is still open —
  this arc's instructions didn't ask for it to be merged, so left untouched.

**** ARC completed **** — governance/process arc, no code; ~1% of whole-project progress. The
write-back gate this arc installs is now itself in effect for every arc after this one.

## 2026-08-09 — Closed PR #3 (stale ARC 002 RESULTS.md) without merging, comment posted; source branch `docs/arc002-results` kept (holds unmerged commit `82efd05`) — confirmed closed via `gh pr view 3`.

## 2026-08-09 — ARC 005: PR #5 + PR #6 catch-up merge, elemets.md / dev_and_services_paln.md investigation

- **Fresh `gh pr list` (per instruction, not assumed):** found two open PRs, not the one gap
  previously reported — **#5** (`docs/arc003-writeback`) and **#6** (`docs/arc004-close-pr3`,
  ARC 004's own write-back, opened last turn and not flagged as still-open at the time).
- **PR #5 merged** cleanly (`b5e04ff`) — no conflict, since PR #6 wasn't merged yet.
- **PR #6 then conflicted** (`mergeable: CONFLICTING`) against the just-merged PR #5 — both had
  appended to the same `SESSION.md`/`RESULTS.md` anchor point. Resolved manually: merged
  `origin/main` into `docs/arc004-close-pr3`, concatenated the `SESSION.md` entries in
  chronological order (ARC 003 entry, authored 08:47, before ARC 004's, authored 08:49), and for
  `RESULTS.md` — which is "overwritten per arc," not cumulative — kept the newer (ARC 004)
  version rather than concatenating, consistent with the file's own definition. Pushed
  (`fd84ffd`), merged cleanly via admin override (`3f62471`).
- **Verified fresh against `origin/main`:** `git log` shows both merge commits (`b5e04ff`,
  `3f62471`); `SESSION.md` has the ARC 003 entry then the ARC 004 entry, in that order;
  `RESULTS.md` shows `## ARC 004`, not still ARC 001.
- **Task 1 (elemets.md ambiguity):** confirmed via `find` — neither `elemets.md` nor
  `elemet_structure.md` exists anywhere under `~/nix`, and `.claude/rules/` doesn't exist.
  Checked the live `CLAUDE.md` text the task described replacing ("purpose unconfirmed; see open
  objective below", an "Open objective" paragraph) — **neither string exists in the file.**
  `CLAUDE-CHANGELOG.md`'s own second entry documents this was already resolved before this
  session: the rules table was already stripped to a status note, the open-objective paragraph
  already dropped. **No-op — no edit, no commit.** Reported rather than fabricated a change to
  force the expected second commit.
- **Task 2 (dev_and_services_paln.md):** confirmed `dev_and_services_paln.md` does not exist —
  only `dev_and_services_plan.md` is present. The "Stale artifact" paragraph the task described
  removing is also already gone, replaced by the "Doc audit (2026-08-09)" confirmation line
  (`CLAUDE-CHANGELOG.md`'s first entry documents this same replacement). **No-op — no edit, no
  commit.**
- **Net result:** both tasks' premises predate this session's actual `CLAUDE.md` state; verified
  on-disk/in-file truth over the brief, per standing directive. Only the PR #5/#6 catch-up merge
  produced changes this arc.

**** ARC completed **** — mostly catch-up + verification, no code; <1% of whole-project progress.
