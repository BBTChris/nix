# SESSION.md — Nix development session log

Append-only. Canonical singular name (per `docs/directory_structure.md` v1.1.0) — never fork
into per-date or per-arc files.

## 2026-08-09 — ARC 001: GitHub Repo Init

- Pre-check: `.claude/rules/` confirmed absent (matches CLAUDE.md's own note). `gh auth status`
  confirmed `BBTChris` (BBT account), active, `repo` scope — proceeded per arc's gate.
- Created private repo `BBTChris/nix` via `gh repo create`.
- `git init -b main` in `~/nix`, `origin` set to `https://github.com/BBTChris/nix.git`.
- Directory skeleton (`scripts,docs,checks,risks,sessions,downloads,web,logs,databases`) was
  already fully present on disk; added `.gitkeep` to the 6 empty dirs (checks, databases, logs,
  risks, scripts, web).
- All six required docs already present under `docs/` with exact filenames from CLAUDE.md's
  table. Two `.docx` specs (`nix-strategy-evaluator-pipeline-6.docx`, `nix_db_schema_spec.docx`)
  also present in `docs/` — not on the arc's six-doc list but already canonical content, included
  in the commit (arc's out-of-scope section doesn't exclude them).
  - **Assumption flagged:** `elements_v2.md` §1.1 names a "master version file" but specifies no
    filename/path. Used the standard convention: `VERSION` at repo root, plain text, `1.0.0`,
    metadata only. Not derived from any spec text — should be confirmed or formalized by a future
    arc/spec update, not treated as settled.
  - `.gitignore` covers credential JSON, `logs/*`, `databases/*`, `*.env`/master-password
    material, standard Python artifacts, plus (beyond arc's list) `.DS_Store`/`._*` macOS cruft
    and `graphify-out/` found already littering `~/nix` — excluded so `git add -A` didn't stage
    junk into version control.
- Committed root commit `aaa6a28` "Initial repo structure + frozen spec docs, v1.0.0" (21 files).
- Tagged `v1.0.0`, pushed `main` + tag to `origin`.
- Branch protection on `main`: confirmed **not** configured — repo's GitHub tier (private, no
  Pro) doesn't currently support it. Logged as a future gate, not an oversight, per arc step 9.
- All 8 definition-of-success boxes verified directly (`gh repo view`, `git remote`, filesystem
  walk, `git ls-remote --tags`, `git status` clean).
- graphify `/graphify` run on `~/nix` was in progress when this arc interrupted it (semantic
  extraction chunk 1/1 failed on subagent output-token overflow, not yet retried) — left paused,
  resuming after this arc.

**** ARC completed **** — ARC 001 moved GitHub Repo Init to 100% done; ~2% of whole-project
progress (infra/provisioning scaffold only, no code yet — R1 seams & skeleton is next).

## 2026-08-09 — Formalized repo/branch policy as `elements_v2.md` §1.1a (commit `eab8e20`, PR pending merge — see prior entry's unresolved solo-dev-merge blocker).
